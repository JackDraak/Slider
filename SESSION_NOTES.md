# Slider Project - Session Notes & Status

## Session Date: 2025-09-30

## Project Status: âœ… COMPLETE & FUNCTIONAL

### What Was Built

A fully functional Rust sliding puzzle game (like "fifteen") with:
- **Model-Controller-Presenter architecture** (MCP pattern)
- **Three entropy calculation methods**:
  1. Manhattan Distance (fast heuristic)
  2. Shortest Path Heuristic (with linear conflict penalties)
  3. A* Actual Solution Length (exact but expensive)
- **Performance monitoring** with microsecond timing and caching
- **Auto-solve feature** with animated 1-second-per-move playback
- **egui-based GUI** with all controls
- **56 passing unit tests** with good coverage
- **Comprehensive documentation** (CLAUDE.md, README.md, inline docs)

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Puzzle Mechanics**:
   - Grid sizes 3Ã—3 to 22Ã—22 (default 4Ã—4)
   - Immediate moves (adjacent tiles)
   - Chain moves (tiles in line with empty cell)
   - Guaranteed solvable shuffles (no backtracking)

2. **Entropy & Difficulty**:
   - Easy/Medium/Hard difficulty levels
   - Real-time entropy display
   - Performance metrics showing calc time for each method

3. **Auto-Solve**:
   - A* pathfinding computes optimal solution
   - Animated playback at 1 move/second
   - Progress indicator (e.g., "3/8")
   - Stop/resume controls

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Entropy metrics cached (only recalculate on state change)
   - Avoids redundant calculations during frame updates
   - Performance timings show actual computation cost

5. **GUI Controls**:
   - Difficulty selection (Easy/Medium/Hard)
   - New Game / Reset buttons
   - Auto Solve / Stop Solve
   - Performance toggle (shows timing: "Manhattan: 24 (calc: 45Î¼s)")
   - Move counter
   - Solved indicator

### Known Issues (From Code Review)

#### CRITICAL (Must Fix Before Production):
1. **A* Memory Leak**: SearchNode parent chain causes exponential memory growth
   - Fix: Use indices into Vec instead of Box<SearchNode> parents
   - Impact: Will crash on complex puzzles

2. **Inefficient State Hashing**: String concatenation in hot path
   - Fix: Use u64 hash instead of String
   - Impact: 10-100x performance penalty

3. **Panic vs Result**: PuzzleState::new() panics on invalid size
   - Fix: Return Result<PuzzleState, PuzzleError>
   - Impact: Library API design flaw

#### MAJOR (Should Fix Soon):
4. Excessive PuzzleState cloning in solver
5. Inconsistent move counting (chain moves count as 1)
6. No error messages when auto-solve fails
7. Shuffle doesn't guarantee target difficulty

#### MINOR:
8. Some clippy warnings
9. Missing doc comments on some public APIs
10. Hardcoded constants (should be configurable)
11. Unused ImageData struct

### Code Quality Score: 6.6/10

**Strengths**:
- Clean MCP architecture (8/10)
- Good test coverage (7/10)
- Comprehensive documentation (8/10)
- Idiomatic Rust style (9/10)

**Weaknesses**:
- Error handling (4/10) - too many panics/bools
- Performance (5/10) - critical issues in solver
- Memory efficiency (5/10) - excessive cloning

### What Works Perfectly Right Now

1. âœ… Basic gameplay (immediate and chain moves)
2. âœ… Shuffling with no-backtrack guarantee
3. âœ… All three entropy calculations
4. âœ… Performance monitoring and caching
5. âœ… Auto-solve for simple puzzles (3Ã—3, 4Ã—4 with low entropy)
6. âœ… GUI with all controls
7. âœ… Unit tests for core logic

### What Needs Work (Priority Order)

1. **Fix A* memory leak** (8-16 hours)
   - Use Vec<SearchNode> with indices instead of Box parent chain
   - Will enable solving harder puzzles without OOM

2. **Optimize state hashing** (2-4 hours)
   - Replace String hash with u64
   - 10-100x speedup in solver

3. **Add proper error types** (4-8 hours)
   - PuzzleError, SolverError, AutoSolveError enums
   - Replace panics with Results

4. **Reduce cloning** (8-12 hours)
   - Use flat array for grid instead of Vec<Vec>
   - Or implement Rc/Arc for shared state
   - Or use copy-on-write pattern

5. **Add integration tests** (4-6 hours)
   - End-to-end gameplay scenarios
   - Full shuffle â†’ solve cycles
   - Performance benchmarks

### Future Enhancements (Nice to Have)

- [ ] Implement undo/redo (infrastructure exists, just needs API)
- [ ] Add save/load game state (use serde)
- [ ] Visual tile slide animations (smooth transitions)
- [ ] Image-based tiles (ImageData is stubbed)
- [ ] Solver progress callbacks (for long solves)
- [ ] Parallel A* search (use rayon)
- [ ] Property-based tests (use proptest)
- [ ] Calibrate difficulty thresholds empirically

### Documentation Files Created

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Developer guide for Claude Code with:
   - Project mechanics and rules
   - Architecture overview (MCP pattern)
   - Key algorithms (entropy, shuffle, solver)
   - Development commands
   - Testing strategy

2. **README.md** - User-facing documentation with:
   - Feature list
   - Quick start guide
   - How the puzzle works
   - Entropy explanation
   - Architecture overview
   - Development instructions
   - Future enhancements roadmap

3. **Cargo.toml** - Configured with:
   - Package metadata
   - Dependencies: egui 0.30, eframe 0.30, rand 0.8
   - Edition 2021

4. **This file (SESSION_NOTES.md)** - Implementation log

### Important Design Decisions Made

1. **MCP Architecture**: Strict separation allows testing model without GUI
2. **Trait for Entropy**: Allows pluggable algorithms and comparison
3. **Caching Strategy**: Metrics cached per state version, not per frame
4. **Auto-solve Timing**: 1 second per move for educational viewing
5. **Chain Moves**: Resolved into immediate moves under the hood
6. **No Backtracking**: Shuffles only move forward, guarantees solvability
7. **Performance Display**: Shows calc time, not frame time (educational)

### Lessons Learned / Key Insights

1. **A* with deep cloning is expensive** - Need to optimize for production
2. **String hashing is slow** - Always use integer hashes in hot paths
3. **Caching is essential** - Solver takes milliseconds, can't run every frame
4. **Error types matter** - Panics are not acceptable for library code
5. **Tests caught bugs early** - All 56 tests passing gave confidence
6. **Documentation pays off** - CLAUDE.md will help future work significantly

### Next Session TODO

If continuing this project:

1. **Immediate**: Fix A* memory leak (highest priority)
2. **Quick win**: Optimize state hashing (big perf boost)
3. **Quality**: Add Result types, remove panics
4. **Testing**: Add integration tests and benchmarks
5. **Polish**: Smooth tile animations, better UX feedback

### Commands for Next Session

```bash
# Continue development
cd /home/jdraak/Development/slider

# Check current state
cargo test        # All 56 should pass
cargo clippy      # Will show some warnings
cargo build --release

# Run the game
./target/release/slider

# Profile performance (if needed)
cargo install flamegraph
cargo flamegraph --release
```
